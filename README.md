# image-sharing-app

This is an image sharing app. The project features a user login and basic image uploader were the user can upload images. 
This project went through three stages until it reached the final product. The user login was made along with a mySQL database to keep
track of those that have logged in. A few lines of Ajax were added to indicate to the user if a username was already taken or available.
The second part was the basic image uploader. Here the professor gave us some sample code that would allow connection to the database in
mySQL where photos would be stored and filters would be applied. The final product was throwing everything together and connecting those
individual parts into a unique image sharing app. The design layout was a bootstrap package from bootstraptaste.com. They did not include 
a license text file with the package.
